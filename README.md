Hi, thank you for your time to evaluate my coding lines in this app. It was a challenging task for a beginning developer like me but it also brought me enormous fun because I had moments of frustration when I was stuck at some puzzles and moments of fun when I solved those problems. Taking into account that only 5 months ago I did not know absolutely anything about coding and IT, in general, to me, this is an indicator of how I can le

This app represents a working version that ideally should be developed further provided there is more time for that. Instead of creatin a json file to host data from the CSV file in the frontend part, the app would benefit from creation of a backend part and a data server (created with the help of MongoDB or SQL) that would host data from SCV file. 

I wrote this code for this app treating a given array as a static data. However, for a dynamic array which gets constantly updated and changed, I would need to implement more functionality to take into account the dynamic changes. React Hooks is a good approach to deal with that kind of problems.

The app needs some styling but this time I did not pay attention to that, as the assignment did not specify that. This app only displays three most frequently advertised pedelec models without any styling.

These are my general remarks about this tech challenge. I would be happy to discuss further details during the next stages of interviews.


Instructions:
I developed this app using JavaScript's React library. To run this app in a local browser, please execute the following command in your terminal:

npm install

and then:
npm start


If you are unfamiliar with React, please find my coding files in the crs folder.
